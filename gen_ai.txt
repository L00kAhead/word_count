To explain the working of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), I will provide a high-level overview of the process. GANs consist of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator's role is to generate synthetic data, such as images, while the discriminator's role is to distinguish between real and fake data. The training process starts with the generator generating random data, which is then passed to the discriminator along with real data. The discriminator's task is to classify the input as real or fake. Initially, both the generator and discriminator are not well-trained, so the discriminator's accuracy is low. As training progresses, the generator learns to generate more realistic data by receiving feedback from the discriminator. The discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between real and fake data. This adversarial relationship between the generator and discriminator leads to the improvement of both models. The training continues iteratively, with the generator trying to generate data that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real data, and the discriminator trying to improve its ability to differentiate between real and fake data. Ultimately, the goal is for the generator to generate data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator becomes unable to differentiate between real and fake data.
